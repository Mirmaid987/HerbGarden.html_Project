  <dt>Care for your plant</dt>

    <dd>Allow oregano plants to grow to about 4 inches tall and then pinch or trim lightly to encourage a denser and bushier plant.
      Regular trimming will not only cause the plant to branch again, but also avoid legginess.</dd>

    <dd>Oregano doesn’t need quite as much water as most herbs. As the amount of watering depends on many variables, just water when the soil
      feels dry to the touch. Remember that it’s better to water thoroughly and less often.</dd>

    <dd>If you have a container, water until the water comes out of the drainage holes in the bottom of the container.
      To ensure the best-quality plants, thin out plants that are 3 or 4 years old in the early spring. Oregano is self-seeding,
      so the plants will easily grow back.</dd>
