  <h1>How to plant your basil</h1>

    To get a jump on the season, start the seeds indoors 6 weeks before the last spring frost.

    To plant outside, wait until the soil has warmed to at least 50°F (10°C)—preferably around 70ºF (21°C) for best growth.

    Nighttime temperatures shouldn’t drop below 50°F (10°C).Don’t rush basil. Without heat, the plant won’t grow well.</p>

    <br>
      Basil will grow best in a location that gets 6 to 8 hours of full sun daily, though it can perform well in partial sun, too.

      Soil should be moist but well-drained.Basil works great in containers or raised beds, as these allow for better drainage.

      If you’re planning on cooking with these plants, plant in clean soil, don’t use insecticides,

      and grow them away from driveways and busy streets so that exhaust won’t settle on the plants.</p>

    <br>
      After the seedlings have produced their first six leaves, prune to above the second set.

      This encourages the plants to start branching, resulting in more leaves for harvest.

      Every time a branch has six to eight leaves, repeat pruning the branches back to their first set of leaves.

      After about 6 weeks, pinch off the center shoot to prevent early flowering. If flowers do grow, just cut them off.

      If the weather is going to be cold or if a sudden frost is imminent, be sure to harvest your basil beforehand,

      as the cold temperatures will destroy your plants.</p>
