<p>Despite its Mediterranean origin, English lavender was so named because it grows well in that country's cooler climate and has

  long been a staple in English herb gardens. The gray-green foliage and whorls of tiny flowers make this one of the most attractive

  lavenders in the garden. It’s one of the most cold-hardy varieties and the best for culinary use because of its low camphor content.</p>


              <h2>Climate Considerations</h2>

              <p>Lavender is a tough, dependable woody perennial that will last for several years under the right conditions.

               Because of its Mediterranean origin, lavender loves blazing hot sun and dry soil.

               If your lavender doesn’t thrive, it’s most likely due to overwatering, too much shade, and high humidity levels.<p>


                  <p>English lavenders and their hybrids are the best varieties for cooler climates, since they are cold hardy north to Zone 5.

                    However, they will grow best in a sheltered location with winter protection.

                    For southern gardens in extremely hot, humid climates, Spanish and French lavenders are more tolerant of the moist conditions, but should be spaced apart to allow good air circulation.

                    If your winters are too harsh or your soil is heavy and dense, consider growing lavender in containers.

                    They will flourish as long as they receive at least 8 hours of direct sunlight a day and are planted in

                    a high-quality potting mix with good drainage.

                    In winter, bring your container plants indoors and place them in a sunny window.</p>

<h1>  LAVENDER SHORTBREAD </h1><br>

            <p>  <b>SEEDSWOMAN RENEE SHEPHERD</b>, owner of <i>Renee's Garden</i> in Felton, California,

              created this garden-inspired treat to serve with tea or sherry.

              She suggests making several batches and tucking them into boxes or tins lined with pastel tissue paper to give as special gifts.</p>

         <ul>

           <li>1-½ cups (3 sticks) butter, at room temperature</li>
           <li>⅔ cup sugar</li>
           <li>2 tablespoons very finely chopped lavender florets, fresh or dried</li>
           <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint</li>
           <li>2-⅓ cups flour</li>
          <li> ½ cup cornstarch</li>
          <li> ¼ teaspoon salt</li>

         </ul>

            <p> <img src="/home/miranda/Desktop/image85-e1468854788945.jpg" alt="Lavender Flowers" width="170" height="120" align="left" >

              Preheat oven to 325°F. Cover the bottoms of two baking sheets with parchment paper.

              In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter, sugar, lavender, and mint with an electric mixer for about 3 minutes,

               until light and fluffy.

                Add the flour, cornstarch, and salt, and beat until incorporated. Divide the dough in half. </p>

              <p>  Flatten into squares and wrap in plastic. Chill until firm.

              On a floured board, roll or pat out each square to a thickness of ½ inch. Cut the dough into 1-½-inch squares or rounds.

               Transfer to baking sheets, spacing the cookies about 1 inch apart. Prick each cookie several times with a fork.

               Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until pale golden (do not brown). Cool slightly, then transfer to a rack.

               Sprinkle with lavender powdered sugar (recipe follows). Makes about 4 dozen.</p>

                  <hr />

            <h2>  Lavender Powdered Sugar </h2>

            <p>  Put 4 or 5 sprigs of lavender flowers into a sealed jar with powdered sugar for a day before using the sugar. <p>
