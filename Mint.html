  <strong>Mint</strong> is a perennial with very fragrant, toothed leaves and tiny purple, pink, or white flowers. It has a fruity, aromatic taste.

There are many varieties of mint—all fragrant, whether shiny or fuzzy, smooth or crinkled, bright green or variegated.

However, you can always tell a member of the mint family by its square stem.</p>


    <p>Rolling it between your fingers, you’ll notice a pungent scent and think of candy, sweet teas, or maybe even mint juleps.

       As well as kitchen companions, mints are used as garden accents, ground covers, air fresheners, and herbal medicines.

       They’re as beautiful as they are functional, and they’re foolproof to grow, thriving in sun and shade all over North America. In fact,

        mint can be vigorous spreaders, so be careful where you plant it.</p>

    <h1><center>Here are some tips to help you start <i>growing</i>!</center></h1>


    <p>Mints are vigorous perennials that thrive in light soil with good drainage.</p><br>

          <p>Ideally, they prefer a moist but well-drained site, something like their native habitat along stream banks.

            Most will tolerate some shade, and the variegated types may require some protection from direct sun.</p><br>

              <p>  For growing outdoors, plant one or two purchased plants (or one or two cuttings from a friend) about 2 feet apart in moist soil.

              One or two plants will easily cover the ground. Mint should grow to be 1 or 2 feet tall.</p><br>

              <p>  For the best growth in confined areas such as containers, topdress plants with a thin layer of compost or organic
              fertilizer every few months.</p> <br>

           <p>   Above ground pots will <em>need</em> winter protection in cold climates.</p><br>

        <p>  In the garden, plant mint near cabbage and tomatoes—in pots, if possible, in order to prevent it from spreading and

          stealing nutrients from your crops!</p><br>
